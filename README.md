This Next.js Weather App provides real-time weather forecasts using the OpenWeatherMap API and features user authentication via Auth0 (email/password & Google OAuth). Users can search for weather conditions, save favorite locations (stored locally), and receive personalized forecasts. The app is styled with Tailwind CSS, uses Axios for API requests, and written with Typescript and Javascript
